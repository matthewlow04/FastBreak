FastBreak is a work in progress project developed by Matthew Low that aims to make pickup basketball as competitive as possible. 

It keeps score of games while saving game data and tracks individual stats for players using CoreData letting you know who the true king of the court is.

The MVVM architechture of this app allows easy editing of previous code which will hopefully help when other people collaborate on this project with me!
